## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
cd backend
npx ts-node
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Login and password to bank site is: L: `ben` P: `ten`
You can deposit and withdraw money to your account, PIN: `1111`

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
